# album_audio_analysis_spotify
This project utilizes the Spotify Web API to retrieve and visualize audio features of tracks from a user-inputted album. The program allows users to select an album, fetches the corresponding audio features for each track, and then generates a data visualization of the selected audio feature using MATLAB.
